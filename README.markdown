Viewing app for Raspberry Pi webcam.

# Requirements

Requires PHP, MySQL and Apache. Nothing unusual.

# Installing

Stick all the files in a directory on your webserver.

Create a MySQL database with a `pictures` table as defined in `table.txt`.

Create a file 'database.inc' based on `database-template.inc`, specifying your database.

Should then work if I haven't missed anything.
